## Task 1: Advanced AI Voice Assistant
An advanced voice-controlled assistant developed using Python that leverages **speech recognition, natural language processing (NLP), and third-party APIs** to perform real-world tasks.  
The assistant can understand voice commands, process user intent, automate actions such as sending emails, fetching weather updates, setting reminders, and answering general knowledge queries.  
The project follows a modular architecture with secure API handling, error management, and extensibility for adding new skills.

**Key Technologies:** Python, Speech Recognition, NLP, APIs, Automation, Secure Configuration

## Task 2: Advanced BMI Calculator
A graphical BMI calculator application built with a **user-friendly GUI** that allows users to calculate Body Mass Index based on height and weight inputs.  
The application supports **multiple users**, stores historical BMI data using a database, categorizes BMI values into health ranges, and visualizes BMI trends using statistical graphs.  
Strong emphasis is placed on **input validation, data persistence, error handling, and user experience design**.

**Key Technologies:** Python, Tkinter, SQLite, Data Visualization, GUI Design
